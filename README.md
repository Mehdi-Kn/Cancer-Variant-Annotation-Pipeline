## Introduction
Understanding the functional implications of genomic variants is crucial in cancer research. Variants can affect gene function, protein structure, and biological pathways, contributing to cancer development and progression. This pipeline provides a systematic approach to annotate and analyze cancer variants, aiding researchers in identifying potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

## Features
- **Variant Annotation**: Annotates genomic variants using Ensembl's Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) via the `biomaRt` package.
- **Functional Impact Prediction**: Predicts the impact of variants on protein function using SIFT and PolyPhen scores.
- **Pathway Enrichment Analysis**: Identifies biological pathways affected by the variants through Reactome pathway analysis.
- **Visualization**: Generates informative plots to visualize variant consequences and enriched pathways.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive explanations for each step, enhancing reproducibility and understanding.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **R (version ≥ 4.0)**.
- **Bioconductor packages**.
- **Internet Connection**: Required for accessing online databases and resources.

### Installing Required Packages

To install all necessary packages, open R or RStudio and run the following script:

```r
# Install BiocManager if not already installed
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

# Install required Bioconductor packages
BiocManager::install(c(
  "VariantAnnotation",
  "biomaRt",
  "GenomicFeatures",
  "org.Hs.eg.db",
  "AnnotationDbi",
  "EnsDb.Hsapiens.v86",
  "ReactomePA",
  "clusterProfiler"
))

# Install additional CRAN packages
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2"))
```

## Usage

### Step 1: Prepare Your Data
1. Place your **Variant Call Format (VCF)** file in the `data/` directory.
2. The VCF file should contain genomic variants obtained from cancer sequencing data.
3. Ensure that the VCF file is indexed if it is large.

**Biological Explanation**:  
Variant Call Format (VCF) files are used to store information about genomic variants, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions, deletions, and other mutations. These variants can significantly impact gene function and contribute to cancer development and progression. Preparing the data involves placing the VCF file in the appropriate directory and ensuring it is indexed for efficient processing.

### Step 2: Run the Annotation Script
- Open R or RStudio and run the following command:

```r
source("scripts/annotate_variants.R")
```

- Modify the script if necessary to specify the correct file paths or reference genome version (e.g., "hg19" or "hg38").

**Biological Explanation**:  
Running the annotation script integrates variant data with external biological information. Using tools like Ensembl's Variant Effect Predictor (VEP), the script annotates each variant with its potential impact on gene function, coding sequences, and protein structures. This step is crucial for understanding the biological significance of each variant.

### Step 3: View Results
- **Annotated Variants**: The results will be saved as `annotated_variants.csv` in the `results/` directory.
- **Visualizations**: Plots will be generated and saved in the `results/` directory, including:
    - Distribution of variant consequences (`variant_consequences.png`).
    - Pathway enrichment dot plot (`pathway_enrichment.png`).

**Biological Explanation**:  
The annotated variants provide detailed insights into each mutation's potential effects, such as whether a mutation is benign or deleterious. Visualizations, like bar plots of variant types or pathway enrichment plots, help interpret the data and reveal patterns that may indicate specific biological processes involved in cancer.

## Pipeline Workflow and Biological Explanation

### 1. Reading Variant Data
Load and preprocess the variant data from a VCF file. VCF files contain detailed information about each genomic variant, such as position, reference allele, and alternative allele.

**Biological Explanation**:  
VCF files are a standard format for representing genetic variations. These files contain information on each variant's position, type, and effect on the genome. Reading these files into R allows us to manipulate and analyze the data computationally.

### 2. Annotating Variants
Utilize Ensembl's Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) through the `biomaRt` package to annotate each variant. Annotation adds biological information, such as gene name, protein consequences, and predicted functional impacts, providing insight into how these variants might affect gene function and contribute to cancer development.

**Biological Explanation**:  
Annotations provide context to the raw variant data, linking mutations to specific genes and predicting their potential impact. This step can reveal whether a variant disrupts protein function, is likely benign, or is involved in critical biological pathways.

### 3. Predicting Functional Impact
Use SIFT and PolyPhen scores to predict whether variants will impact protein function. SIFT scores indicate the probability of a variant being deleterious, while PolyPhen scores reflect the likely impact on protein structure and function.

**Biological Explanation**:  
Certain mutations can alter protein function, affecting cellular processes. Predictive tools like SIFT and PolyPhen assess the likelihood of these alterations being harmful or neutral, helping to prioritize variants for further research.

### 4. Pathway Enrichment Analysis
Perform pathway enrichment analysis using the `ReactomePA` package to identify biological pathways affected by the variants. This helps to understand the broader biological implications of the identified variants.

**Biological Explanation**:  
Pathway enrichment analysis identifies which biological pathways are disproportionately affected by the observed variants. This step can reveal critical processes that are disrupted in cancer, such as cell cycle regulation or DNA repair mechanisms.

### 5. Visualization
Generate visualizations to summarize the distribution of variant types and highlight significantly enriched pathways, facilitating interpretation of the results.

**Biological Explanation**:  
Visualizations provide a clear, graphical representation of complex data, making it easier to identify trends and patterns. By visualizing the distribution of variants and enriched pathways, researchers can quickly grasp the overall impact of mutations and focus on the most critical findings.
